# DTOS v1.4.1 — Provider Activation & Data Normalization Platform

DTOS now normalizes every provider opinion before it reaches storage, consensus, or intelligence. Official Sleeper trending data is activated, and player pages explain exactly which provider values exist, how fresh and reliable they are, and why other values are unavailable.

## Highlights

- Canonical DTOS player identities reconcile Sleeper, FantasyCalc, KeepTradeCut, FantasyPros, Underdog, and Dynasty Daddy identifiers when supplied.
- Normalization covers names, teams, position eligibility, free agents, rookies, values, rankings, ADP, timestamps, confidence, and metadata.
- Invalid values, broken IDs, provider mismatches, and conflicting metadata are blocked before entering consensus.
- Provider reliability tracks success, failure, schema stability, and latency.
- Consensus 2.1 weights confidence, reliability, freshness, agreement, coverage, and missing sources without using a simple average.
- Sleeper trending adds and drops use the documented public API and remain cached for offline operation.
- Player dossiers display normalized identity, consensus, provider values, freshness, confidence, availability, licensing, and unavailable reasons.
- `/api/players/{player_id}/intelligence` exposes the full normalized player contract.
- Settings provides a Provider Activation Dashboard.
