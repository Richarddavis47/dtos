# DTOS v1.4.3 — Public Crawl API

DTOS now exposes the synchronized public league state through fast, cached, read-only JSON endpoints designed for ChatGPT and other standards-compliant crawlers.

## Highlights

- `/api/crawl` publishes version, league, sync, page, endpoint, and cache discovery metadata.
- `/api/crawl/snapshot` consolidates public league, roster, standings, picks, matchup, transaction, Front Office, trade, ranking, recommendation, alert, and sync data.
- Section endpoints provide teams, Front Offices, trades, transactions, matchups, picks, and standings without triggering Sleeper synchronization.
- Crawl artifacts use the shared intelligence cache, are isolated by league and sync generation, and invalidate after successful synchronization.
- Public serialization excludes credentials, environment variables, internal paths, and administrator-only state.
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` make the public site discoverable while excluding mutation and administrative paths.
- FantasyCalc and DynastyProcess public values now refresh into the canonical market cache with visible attribution.
- Sleeper player metadata, depth-chart fields, ownership, transactions, and trending activity reach player pages end to end.
- Provider failures preserve prior data only as a disclosed cached fallback; unsupported sources state the exact limitation.
- Bijan Robinson resolves to Sleeper ID `9509`; FantasyCalc value `10213` remains a value, never an identity.
- Canonical DTOS player identities reconcile Sleeper, FantasyCalc, KeepTradeCut, FantasyPros, Underdog, and Dynasty Daddy identifiers when supplied.
- Normalization covers names, teams, position eligibility, free agents, rookies, values, rankings, ADP, timestamps, confidence, and metadata.
- Invalid values, broken IDs, provider mismatches, and conflicting metadata are blocked before entering consensus.
- Provider reliability tracks success, failure, schema stability, and latency.
- Consensus 2.1 weights confidence, reliability, freshness, agreement, coverage, and missing sources without using a simple average.
- Sleeper trending adds and drops use the documented public API and remain cached for offline operation.
- Player dossiers display normalized identity, consensus, provider values, freshness, confidence, availability, licensing, and unavailable reasons.
- `/api/players/{player_id}/intelligence` exposes the full normalized player contract.
- Settings provides a Provider Activation Dashboard.
